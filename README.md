# Samsara

A Metaverse project where you can buy and trade land/properties and build upon them. Samsara literally means 'world' in sanskrit

I used three js to make a 3D world and then enabled buying land/properties in that world. The project does not solve any problem but I made it because it looked fun and I wanted to make something interesting and something which I am really passionate about, coincidently at the time I came to know about polygon fellowship 2022 and applied with this project.

## Technology Stack & tools used:

- Solidity (Writing Smart Contract)
- Javascript (React & Testing)
- Web3 (Blockchain Interaction)
- Truffle (Development Framework)
- Ganache (For Local Blockchain)
- MetaMask (Ethereum Wallet)
- ThreeJS (3D Javascript library)
- @react-three/fiber (React renderer for Three.js)
- @react-three/drei (Extra helpers for React-Three-Fiber)

Note: Use goerli network to access the plot and buying function and connect wallet

## Things left to improve:

- Improving the css all over the project
- Adding trade feature beside already implemented buying feature
- Day/night cycle based on system time
- Adding animated models to add some life to it
